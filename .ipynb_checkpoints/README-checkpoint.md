# NYC-subway-ridership-forecasting
This project forecasts subway ridership in New York City using historical turnstile data combined with external factors like weather and local events.

## 🔍 Objective
Improve the accuracy of transit demand forecasting by incorporating multiple data sources.

## 📊 Models Used
- SARIMA (statsmodels)
- Prophet (Facebook)
- Optional: LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)

## 📁 Data Sources
- NYC MTA Turnstile: [link](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
- NOAA / OpenWeatherMap API
- NYC Event Calendars

## 🛠 Tools
Python, pandas, statsmodels, Prophet, Streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📈 Results
- Prophet model with external regressors improved MAE by X%
- Key drivers: temperature, holidays, event days
