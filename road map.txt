1. Explore and Analyze the Data More Deeply
* Check for seasonality (weekly, monthly, yearly patterns) in ridership.
* Look at trends and any abrupt changes (e.g., pandemic effects).
* Analyze correlations between ridership and other variables like weather or events.
2. Integrate External Data Sources
* Fetch and merge weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) for each date.
* Add event indicators (holidays, major local events) as binary or categorical features.
3. Feature Engineering
* Create lag features (e.g., ridership on previous days) to capture temporal dependencies.
* Add rolling statistics like rolling mean/median/std as additional features.
* Generate time features (day of week, month, holiday flags).
4. Modeling: Baseline and Advanced
* Start with a SARIMA model on ridership to capture seasonality/trends.
* Fit Prophet model with external regressors (weather, events).
* Optionally try an LSTM for sequence learning if you want deep learning.
5. Model Evaluation
* Use appropriate metrics (MAE, RMSE) to evaluate your models.
* Plot predicted vs actual ridership over time for visual validation.
* Perform cross-validation or train/test splits carefully to avoid data leakage.
6. Interpret Results and Insights
* Identify key drivers from the models (e.g., temperature, events) and quantify their impact.
* Analyze residuals to understand where models struggle.
7. Visualization and Presentation
* Build interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit) to visualize ridership forecasts with controls for weather or events.
* Summarize findings clearly, emphasizing improvements and key factors.
